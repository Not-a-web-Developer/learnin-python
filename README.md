# What is this repository?
This is a basic introduction to python as I see it.

## How to use this
each file covers a single topic, while wach folder covers broad range of topics.

inside each file, python comments explain what's happening and what your task is, for that file. it looks like this:

```python
# this is a comment
print("hello world!")
# the above line prints the text "hello world!" in the console.
# change out the text inside to anything you want, and run it again!
```
